WARNING: DO NOT USE ANY CODE IN THIS REPO! IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD NOT USE UNVETTED CRYPTORAPYY!

This is a placeholder repo. No significant work has been done on this project yet.

<b>Roadmap:</b>
    
A repository to hold practice implementations of cryptosystems. The purpose of this is to gain a greater understanding of 
cryptography algorithims and any code in this repository should be considered unsafe. But feel free to break the  
implementations here if you want to practic cryptanalysis. If you do, send me the results in email and I will make corrections 
if possible and list you in the README.
